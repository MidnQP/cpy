# 🇨libavoidrepitition 

##### Built-in methods of   <img src=https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/1887_python.png height=15 width=16> implemented in 🇨 for reducing sophistication, and blazing-fast performance.
<br>

#### GETTING INVOLVED
Some implementations being simple & stupid is always acceptable, unless they _degrade performance_ or _cause security issues_. To contribute code to the upstream:
1. Fork this project.
2. Make implementations that cover multiple data types.
3. Pull request.
4. Code review + Merge!!
<br>

#### ROAD-MAP
✅ Implemented  
☐ Yet to implement
: :  Return value
[!] Needs to support multiple data type 
```C
✅ assert(expression)        :: True | False",
☐  getarg("c", "-o", "def")  :: Parses the cmdline<c> of a program & returns value against the option <-o>. If not found, default value is "def".
☐  file_read(filename)       :: File's content
☐  in(arr, item)             :: 0 | 1 [!]
☐  isequal(any, any, ...)    :: 0 | 1 [!]
☐  len(any)                  :: Length of anything [!]  
✅ max(arr, len(arr))        :: Item with the maximum value",
✅ min(arr, len(arr))        :: Item with the minimum value",
☐  print(any, any, ...)      :: Writes to stdout [!]
☐  self_document(__FILE__)   :: Automatically self-documents source code, following a simple format.
☐  sort(arr, len(arr))       :: An array with the items sorted.
☐  str(any)                  :: Converts anything to str [!]
☐  str_split(str, delim)     :: An array of strings, separated by delim.
✅ substr(str, substr)       :: substring up to matched",
✅ sum(arr, len(arr))        :: Sum of the array of numbers",
☐  sys_out("command")        :: Unlike os.system(), this returns the output.
☐  type(variable name)       :: Integer corresponding to a type [!]


//Let's make C behave like a scripting language!
//Unsophisticated to write, neat to read.
