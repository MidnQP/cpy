---- libavoidrepitition.h ----
This library aims to implement in C the builtin and/or most useful functions of the interpreted Python3 programming language, as Python3 is almost 30x slower compared to C. Mainly because Python3 source needs to run on a VM, rather than being compiled into CPU native binary.




---- GETTING INVOLVED ----
To contribute code to the upstream:
  1. Fork this project.
  2. Make "polymorphic" implementations. See issue#4.
  3. Do a pull request to this project.
  4. Code review + Merge!!
